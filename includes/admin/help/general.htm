<h3>Theme Options</h3>
<p>
The theme options are a great way to change the look and feel of your site. Most options are self-explanatory so im only going to run through a couple.   
</p>
<p>
The "Theme Accent Color" option will change various colors on your site, mostly links and background colors. <b>Warning:</b> light & dark colors will blend in with icons, backgrounds, and text.  
</p>
<p>
The "Sidebar Column" option will change the width of your sidebar. Four column is about 300px wide and three column is about 220px wide.  
</p>
<p>
The "Custom CSS" option is one of the most important options in the theme for customizing your site. 
Code entered into the textarea is included right before the closing &lt;/HEAD&gt; tag on each page of your site. 
The most important use for this area is to enter custom CSS rules to control the look of your site.
